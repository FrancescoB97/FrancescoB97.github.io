        "Since I was young I'm addicted to computers. I love to spend my free time admiring animation and computer graphic works, but also living firsthand adventures in which other people have put their souls. I am also passionate about strategy, which led me to make a showcase of demanding but also goliardic board games.",
        "I have always seen myself as a good combination of rationality and sentimentality, a combination that led me to appreciate psychology very much by deepening with several readings. Thanks to psychology and my experiences in group work, I understood how fundamental good communication and good relationship with all colleagues/customers are.\nOne of the objectives of my life is in fact to be able to achieve something, whether it is a video game or a short film, capable of exciting and transporting deep teachings.",
        "My love for science and computer science led me to achieve a three-year degree at the Polytechnic of Turin in Computer engineering, and the passion for video games made me choose the graphics and multimedia branch, with some pinch of IT security, another field that has always passionate me. Now I am almost at the end of this intense journey that I am proud to have chosen because it allowed me to grow and open my mind."
