  "intro": "Project of Virtual Reality course at Politecnico of Turin, made by a team of 5 engineers (me, 2 multimedia and 2 design)",
  "teachings": "This is perhaps the course in which I learned more notions than ever. In addition to the theoretical aspects of VR/AR/AX and the cruel world of ants, I acquired Team Manager skills, as I found myself having to manage the various operations and exploit the previous skills of my companions to carry out the job in the most way effective possible. Moreover, I had the opportunity to learn a game engine like Unity that had fascinated me since the time of high school. In this course, I learned navigation and interaction in virtual environments, physical simulations, autonomous agents, spatialized audio, and techniques to optimize. Autonomously, I deepened on Coroutines, the use of the Dotween library, and obtained a base knowledge of asynchronous calls. Allow me to say to be responsible for the entire code section. I, therefore, found myself developing the skills in Blender, Unity, C#, Audacity, and DaVinci",
