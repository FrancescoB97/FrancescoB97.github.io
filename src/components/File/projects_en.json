    "descrizione": "Retro style game, written in OpenGL and C/C ++, in which the user must obtain the highest possible score, dodging rocks, shooting the Kraken, and paying attention to the mermaids. There are bonuses, such as the treasure, which increases the score, and malus, like the siren that switches the control keys. All spiced with an increase in speed of the incremental game that makes the experience more difficult and challenging",

    "insegnamenti": "This is perhaps the course in which I learned more notions than ever. In addition to the theoretical aspects of VR/AR/AX and the cruel world of ants, I acquired Team Manager skills, as I found myself having to manage the various operations and exploit the previous skills of my companions to carry out the job in the most way effective possible. Moreover, I had the opportunity to learn a game engine like Unity that had fascinated me since the time of high school. In this course, I learned navigation and interaction in virtual environments, physical simulations, autonomous agents, spatialized audio, and techniques to optimize. Autonomously, I deepened on Coroutines, the use of the Dotween library, and obtained a base knowledge of asynchronous calls. Allow me to say to be responsible for the entire code section. I, therefore, found myself developing the skills in Blender, Unity, C#, Audacity, and DaVinci",
