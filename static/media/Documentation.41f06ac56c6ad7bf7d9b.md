Training in virtual reality (VR) is a highly immersive and interactive learning method which enables learners to engage in simulated real-world scenarios. 
This approach provides a unique opportunity for learners to practice and develop critical skills in a safe and controlled environment, without the risk of causing harm to themselves or others.  

By offering a safe space to learn, trainees can experiment with different scenarios, make mistakes, and refine their skills in a risk-free environment. 
VR training has been shown to be a highly effective learning method across a wide range of fields, including medical and veterinary education. Compared to traditional classroom or e-learning methods, VR training is more engaging, efficient, and faster.

This approach not only enhances learnersâ€™ retention of knowledge and skills but also helps them to gain confidence in applying them in real-life situations.

This thesis is focused on the development and implementation of a software program designed to simulate an equine endoscopy procedure in collaboration with the Department of Veterinary Science of the University of Turin. The primary goal of this project is to create a virtual learning tool for educational purposes that will replace, either entirely or in part, the traditional training process for this procedure.

By doing so, it will overcome some of the limitations related to the limited availability of patients and the risks associated with performing this procedure on live animals. The aim is to integrate the work that has been done, enhancing its functionality, with a mechanism for simulating certain diseases and for monitoring and evaluating the student, who must be able to follow the analysis procedure correctly.

To summarize, the validity and efficiency of this tool will be evaluated by collecting and analyzing the results of experiments carried out by students who have tried out the application. These experiments will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the tool and its potential to enhance the learning experience for veterinary students.

The results of these experiments will also serve as an important reference for future research and development in the field of veterinary medicine and education.",
